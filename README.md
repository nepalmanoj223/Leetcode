# Leetcode
This repository contains my daily LeetCode solutions and notes.
Goal:
- Stay consistent
- Improve problem-solving skills
- Get better at DSA for interviews and real-world coding
- I am wayy to lazy to write commits by myself but that doesnot mean the code is A.I. only the commit message and discription is from Github A.I. rest lets read and keep on reading.
